# Before attending the datathon

At least a week before the datathon, it is important that you request access to the MIMIC-III database by following the steps numbered below. The database, although de-identified, contains detailed information regarding the clinical care of patients, so it must be treated with appropriate care and respect.

- First register on the CITI program website, selecting “Massachusetts Institute of Technology Affiliates” as your organization affilitation: https://www.citiprogram.org/index.cfm?pageID=154&icat=0&ac=0
